## Installation

## The Twelve (XII) Factors

#### **I. Codebase** - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

All code for this app (front-end, back-end, deployment) is contained in this repository, thus fulfilling factor `1`.

#### **II. Dependencies** - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies


#### **III. Config** - Store config in the environment


#### **IV. Backing services** - Treat backing services as attached resources


#### **V. Build, release, run** - Strictly separate build and run stages


#### **VI. Processes** - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes


#### **VII. Port binding** - Export services via port binding


#### **VIII. Concurrency** - Scale out via the process model


#### **IX. Disposability** - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown


#### **X. Dev/prod parity** - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible


#### **XI. Logs** - Treat logs as event streams


#### **XII. Admin processes** - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
